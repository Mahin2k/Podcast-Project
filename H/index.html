      <p id="text"> Katsushika Hokusai, a japanese artist took a lot of inspiration and influence from western artwork even though japan and the U.S. didn’t have the best connection back then. This resulted in the western people being influenced by his artwork too.
<br /><br />
  This podcast is interesting because I saw artwork very similar to ‘The great wave off kanagawa’ in hokusai’s print series at the MET where I visited the asian art section. The MET has lots of artwork similar to this and I got to see artwork from the same period as Hokusai’s, the Edo period.
