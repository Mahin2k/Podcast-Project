        <h2>Three Nuclear Close Calls</h2>
        <center>
      <p id="text"> The podcast , Three Nuclear Close Calls, is exactly what it sounds like. Times that we were close to a nuclear war. Which includes the norwegian rocket incident, issues with soviet union, and cuban missile crisis. The funny thing in this podcast was the trend of the title “The man who saved the world”, because a few people saved the world from nuclear war.
<br /><br />
  The sad thing about this podcast was when a person was jailed for preventing a war. His name was petrov and he suspected the warnings systems alarm was false because it was one of the soviet satellites. He called it a false alarm and got interrogated right afterwards. This podcast was interesting because I wasn’t even aware about these incidents.
