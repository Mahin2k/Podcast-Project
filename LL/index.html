        <h2>Lose Lose</h2>

      <p id="text">This podcast is about 2 women’s doubles teams in badminton fighting to lose. Regardless of the sport you play, your objective is supposed to be to win. That made me wonder what sports would look like if everyone played to lose. In this case both these teams tried to lose… to win.
<br /><br />
 Allow me to explain how losing can result in winning. See, in this tournament match, whoever won would go against a stronger and more formidable opponent. Which  neither of the teams wanted to do, so if you lost you would go against a easier and less formidable team where you would have a higher chance of winning. What made this podcast really interesting and funny was how each team were trying to look like they are trying to win, when they were really--trying to lose.
