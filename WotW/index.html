        The war of the worlds is a science fiction novel by H.G. Wells where aliens (namely martians) invade earth. This podcast narrated by Jad however, is about when Orson Welles decided lots of people actually believing that martians were invading New Jersey.
<br /><br />
 I chose this podcast because I like sci-fi.I like sci-fi books, games, movies etc. The idea of aliens invading is really interesting and I am curious about how they would look. This was also interesting to listen to when things got serious and people were actually panicking because of this stunt.
