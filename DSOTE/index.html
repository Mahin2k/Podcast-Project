        <h2>Dark Side Of The Earth</h2>
        <center>
      <p id="text"> This podcast is the idea of the pitch black darkness in space. Astronauts aboard the ISS can choose a person to talk to on earth. Mark Vande Hei, an astronaut chose WNYC Studios radioLab. This story was narrated by Mark Vande Hei.
<br /><br />
 In space the contrast between light and dark is extremely high. Since the ISS travels at around 17,000 mph, it switches between light and darkness very quickly. Mark talks about doing spacewalks and the science of flying in the ISS. This is very interesting to listen to because it tells us how people experience space.
