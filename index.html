        <p><span class="bold">Hosts:</span> Tracy V. Wilson, Holly Frey</p>
        <p><span class="bold">About:</span> Tracy V. Wilson has loved stories for as long as she can remember, and her focus since 2013 has been stories about the past. She joined HowStuffWorks as a staff writer in 2005, and she spent her first few years at the site destroying gadgets and mining patents, papers and interviews to figure out what makes things tick. In 2007, she took on the role of hiring and training HowStuffWorks’ new writers and editors. She became site director in 2010 and editorial director in 2014. Tracy cohosted the PopStuff pop culture podcast with Holly Frey; the pair now cohosts Stuff You Missed in History Class.
     <p>Holly Frey is cohost of Stuff You Missed in History Class, and she's also an executive producer for the HowStuffWorks podcast network. Her true historical passion is fashion from all eras. She lives in Atlanta with her husband and a small herd of cats. When she’s not obsessing over comma placement or talking about the past, she’s sewing, running, watching television, visiting a Disney park, rescuing animals, going to the movies, traipsing around town in a ridiculous costume or obsessing over delicious food. Sometimes, she does several of these things at once.</p>
