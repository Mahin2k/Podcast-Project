        <h2>The 47 Ronin and Samurai's Code</h2>
        <center>
      <p id="text">The 47 Ronin and samurais code was narrated by Holly and Tracy from Stuff You Missed In History Class. In japanese history, the samurai were warriors who were loyal to their feudal lords. Much like the european medieval times, where knights would be loyal to their kings. The ronin, however are just samurais gone rogue. When that happens, they either have to commit seppuku (a japanese ritual suicide) or they get killed by the samurai and their head gets put in a bucket and get taken to their master.
<br /><br />
   What made this podcast interesting was the code of honor the samurai follow. If you disobey the rules you have to commit seppuku and regain your honor. This is interesting because it makes zero sense. The system should really be to repent to gain your honor.
